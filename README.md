# Hash Map Implementation

## Description

This project is a custom implementation of a Hash Map (or Hash Table) in JavaScript, designed to store key-value pairs efficiently. It demonstrates fundamental data structure concepts, including hashing, collision handling, and dynamic resizing.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data Structures & Algorithms
- JavaScript programming
- Hashing functions
- Collision resolution using linked lists
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript

## Installation Instructions

To install and set up the Hash Map project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Ephraim-9/hash-map.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hash-map
   ```
3. Open the project files in your preferred code editor to explore and test the Hash Map implementation.

## Usage

This Hash Map class provides the following functionalities:

- **set(key, value):** Inserts or updates a key-value pair.
- **get(key):** Retrieves the value associated with a key.
- **has(key):** Checks if a key exists in the map.
- **remove(key):** Deletes a key-value pair from the map.
- **length():** Returns the number of stored key-value pairs.
- **clear():** Empties the entire hash map.
- **values():** Returns an array of all stored values.
- **entries():** Returns an array of all key-value pairs.

## Features

- Efficient key-value storage and retrieval
- Hash function to distribute keys evenly
- Collision resolution using linked lists
- Dynamic resizing to maintain performance

## Learning Outcomes

This project strengthened my understanding of how hash maps function under the hood. It reinforced concepts such as:

- The importance of hashing and avoiding collisions.
- Managing linked lists to handle multiple values at the same index.
- Implementing dynamic array resizing for efficiency.
- Applying Object-Oriented Programming principles for better code structure.
